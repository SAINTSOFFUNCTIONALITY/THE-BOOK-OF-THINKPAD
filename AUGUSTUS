THE STORY OF AUGUSTUS
 Augustus was a poverty-stricken man during the age of the Roman Empire. Contrary to popular
belief, computers were in widespread use in Roman times. Schools and governments were the
primary consumers of all the computers produced by the Chinese. Several patricians had
computers--beautiful, marble-encased devices, columns all around. Patricians' applications of
now-termed "personal computers" (then "patrician computing machines") were very limited
without networking. As a result, the Romans had plebians and slaves build the Computer
Acqueduct--now commonly misbelieved to have been used for water transportation--which lead
to the great Forum: "IVchan".
